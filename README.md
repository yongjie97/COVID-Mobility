# Predict Mobility during COVID-19
In recent years, mobility of each country has seen drastic changes due to COVID-19. Let us predict the factors that affect mobility the most. Every country have different variables (e.g. population density, vaccination rate). How can we group country that are similar together? By doing so, can we improve the prediction accuracy?
